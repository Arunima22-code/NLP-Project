# NLP Project

This repository contains a Natural Language Processing (NLP) project designed for:
- **Multi-label Text Classification** using transformer-based models.
- **Entity Extraction** leveraging domain-specific knowledge.
- **Summarization** with context-aware pre-trained models.

## Features
1. Preprocess and augment text data for enhanced model accuracy.
2. Train and evaluate multi-label classification models using `distilbert-base-uncased`.
3. Extract domain-specific entities (e.g., competitors, features) via:
   - Exact matching.
   - Fuzzy matching.
   - Named Entity Recognition (NER).
4. Generate dynamic summaries enriched with extracted entities.

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Notebook
1. Open the `project_notebook.ipynb` file in Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook.
2. Follow the instructions in the notebook to:
   - Preprocess and augment data.
   - Train and evaluate the model.
   - Extract entities and summarize text snippets.
3. Modify parameters as needed for your specific use case.

### Key Scripts
- **Training the Model**:
  Run the training pipeline in the notebook to generate the model file:
  ```
  transformer_multi_label_classifier.pkl
  ```

- **Inference Pipeline**:
  Use the trained model to classify new text snippets and extract entities.

## Example Usage
Sample input text:
```plaintext
CompetitorX offers advanced real-time analytics at a lower pricing model.
We need cost reduction to match their capabilities.
```

Output:
- **Classification Labels**: `['Pricing Discussion', 'Features']`
- **Extracted Entities**: 
  - Competitors: `CompetitorX`
  - Features: `real-time analytics`
  - Pricing Keywords: `cost reduction`
- **Summary**:
  ```
  CompetitorX offers advanced real-time analytics at a lower pricing model.
  Competitors: CompetitorX | Features: real-time analytics | Pricing Keywords: cost reduction
  ```

## Notes
- Ensure you have GPU acceleration enabled in Colab for faster training.
- The project uses `Optuna` for hyperparameter tuning—reduce the number of trials for quicker experimentation.
