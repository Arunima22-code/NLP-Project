---

## 1. Set Up Development Environment

### Why This Step?
You need a consistent place to run and share your code. This helps you avoid environment/version conflicts (e.g., differing library versions). It also makes it easier for others to replicate your work and ensures that your final Docker container will run correctly.

### How To Do It
1. **Choose a coding environment**:
   - **Google Colab** (very common for quick AI experimentation; free GPU/TPU time).
   - **Local environment** (PyCharm, VSCode, etc.) if you prefer everything on your own machine.
   - **Virtual environment / Conda environment** to isolate your dependencies.

2. **Install the required Python libraries**:
   - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation.
   - `scikit-learn` or `pytorch`/`tensorflow` for classification models.
   - `spaCy` or `transformers` (Hugging Face) for advanced NLP (optional but recommended).
   - `flask` or `fastapi` for building your REST API.
   - `nltk` or `spacy` for text preprocessing, tokenization, etc.
   - `docker` (eventually) for containerization, or Docker Desktop if you’re on Windows.

3. **Version Control**:
   - Create a **GitHub repository** (public, as requested).
   - Ensure you commit your code notebooks, Python scripts, and Dockerfiles.

#### Pro Tip (Advanced but Simple):
- Use [**Hugging Face Transformers**](https://github.com/huggingface/transformers) if you want a powerful pre-trained model approach for classification and NER. It’s widely recognized and can give you a strong baseline with minimal extra code.

---

## 2. Generate or Collect Synthetic Data

### Why This Step?
The assignment requires a dataset (`calls_dataset.csv`) of at least 100 rows with multi-label categories. You also need a domain knowledge file (`domain_knowledge.json`) to do the dictionary-based entity extraction. The project is “synthetic,” so you’ll invent or semi-randomly generate the text snippets.

### How To Do It
1. **Create your CSV** (`calls_dataset.csv`):
   - Fields:
     1. **id**: A unique identifier (e.g., 1, 2, 3…).
     2. **text_snippet**: A short piece of text (e.g., “We love the analytics, but CompetitorX has a cheaper subscription.”).
     3. **labels**: A comma-separated list of labels (e.g., “Positive, Pricing Discussion, Competition”).
   - Make sure you have a variety of text (at least 100 rows) to represent different scenarios: some that talk about pricing, some that mention competitors, some about product features, objections, compliance, security, etc.

2. **Create the domain knowledge JSON** (`domain_knowledge.json`):
   - Example structure:
     ```json
     {
       "competitors": ["CompetitorX", "CompetitorY", "CompetitorZ"],
       "features": ["analytics", "AI engine", "data pipeline"],
       "pricing_keywords": ["discount", "renewal cost", "budget", "pricing model"]
     }
     ```
   - This dictionary will help for simple “string matching” to detect domain-specific entities.

#### Pro Tip (Advanced but Simple):
- **Randomization script**: Write a small Python script that picks random text pieces, competitor names, product features, etc., to automatically generate 100+ rows. This shows you’re systematically creating data instead of manually writing everything.

---

## Step 3: Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

1. **Loading the Dataset**  
   - **What**: We read our `calls_dataset.csv` into a DataFrame.  
   - **Why**: We need a structured data format (DataFrame) to easily manipulate and inspect the text.

2. **Removing Duplicates**  
   - **What**: We dropped any repeated rows.  
   - **Why**: Duplicate data can lead to overfitting (the model sees the same text multiple times), and it inflates our dataset without real new information.

3. **Text Normalization**  
   - **What**: We converted the text to lowercase, removed punctuation, stripped extra spaces, and optionally removed digits.  
   - **Why**: Standardizing text (e.g., “Hello” vs. “hello”) helps the model treat words consistently. Removing punctuation often reduces noise in bag-of-words methods.

4. **Tokenization & Lemmatization**  
   - **What**: We split each sentence into individual words (tokens), then converted each word to its root form (lemmatizing “running” → “run”).  
   - **Why**: Tokenization is needed so the model can work with each word. Lemmatization helps group variations of the same word (e.g., “runs,” “running,” “ran”) so they’re treated as one term.

5. **Splitting Labels**  
   - **What**: We turned comma-separated label strings (e.g., “Pricing Discussion, Security”) into Python lists (e.g., `["Pricing Discussion", "Security"]`).  
   - **Why**: Multi-label classification frameworks need labels in a list form to handle multiple tags per snippet.

6. **Saving the Cleaned Dataset**  
   - **What**: We wrote the final output to `calls_dataset_cleaned.csv`.  
   - **Why**: Re-saving ensures all processing steps are done once, and we can reuse the cleaned file without repeating the cleaning each time.

---

In **simple terms**: these steps transform raw, messy text into a consistent format, remove duplicates, and prepare our labels properly. This makes the data **ready** for the **modeling** stages (classification, entity extraction, etc.) so the algorithms can learn patterns more effectively.

---

### Documentation for Step 4: Data Augmentation

---

#### **What is Data Augmentation?**
Data augmentation involves creating new, slightly modified versions of existing data to improve the diversity of the dataset. In this case, we applied augmentation techniques to text snippets in the dataset to handle potential class imbalances and enhance the performance of the machine learning model.

---

#### **Why Did We Use It?**
1. **Address Class Imbalance**: Some labels may have fewer examples in the dataset, causing the model to perform poorly on those labels. Augmentation balances this.
2. **Improve Model Generalization**: By introducing variations, the model learns better and avoids overfitting.
3. **Enrich Dataset Variety**: It helps simulate real-world variability, making the dataset more robust.

---

#### **How Did We Implement It?**
We used the following augmentation techniques on each row of the dataset:

1. **Synonym Replacement**: Replace random words with synonyms (e.g., "discount" → "rebate").
2. **Random Insertion**: Insert new random words from a predefined dictionary (e.g., adding "performance" in the sentence).
3. **Random Deletion**: Randomly delete words from the text while keeping the sentence meaningful.
4. **Random Swap**: Swap the positions of two random words in the sentence.

For each row in the original dataset, **4 new augmented rows** were generated, resulting in a dataset 5 times larger than the original.

---

#### **Code Implementation Summary**

- **Input**: `calls_dataset_cleaned.csv` (150 rows).
- **Output**: `augmented_calls_dataset.csv` (750 rows).

Key Steps:
1. Load the dataset with `pandas`.
2. Apply augmentation techniques on each text snippet.
3. Combine original and augmented rows.
4. Save the combined dataset to a CSV file.

---

#### **How Is This Helpful?**
1. **Balanced Dataset**: Rare labels like "Objection" or "Security" now have more examples, reducing model bias toward common labels.
2. **Enhanced Model Performance**: The model sees a variety of text structures and learns better patterns, improving accuracy and robustness.
3. **Scalable**: Even with a small dataset, augmentation creates enough data for training.

---

#### **Example**

**Original Text**:
> "We are impressed with the analytics engine, but CompetitorA has a cheaper pricing model."

**Augmented Versions**:
1. **Synonym Replacement**:
   > "We are amazed with the analytics engine, but CompetitorA has a cheaper pricing model."
2. **Random Insertion**:
   > "We are impressed with the analytics engine, but CompetitorA pricing has a cheaper pricing model."
3. **Random Deletion**:
   > "We are with analytics engine, but CompetitorA has pricing model."
4. **Random Swap**:
   > "We are analytics impressed with the engine, but CompetitorA has a cheaper pricing model."

---

#### **Final Dataset Summary**
- **Original Rows**: 150
- **Augmented Rows**: 600
- **Total Rows**: 750
- **Output File**: `augmented_calls_dataset.csv`


---
### Documentation: Step 5 - Multi-Label Text Classification

---

#### **Objective**
To train a machine learning model that can assign multiple labels (categories) to a single text snippet from the dataset. Each snippet in the dataset can belong to one or more categories, such as "Pricing Discussion," "Competition," or "Positive."

---

#### **What We Did**
1. **Loaded the Dataset**:
   - Used the augmented dataset `augmented_calls_dataset.csv` created in Step 4.
   - Each row in the dataset contains:
     - `text_snippet`: A sales/marketing-related text.
     - `labels`: Comma-separated labels indicating the snippet's categories.

2. **Preprocessed the Data**:
   - Converted comma-separated labels into **lists** (e.g., `"Positive, Pricing Discussion"` → `["Positive", "Pricing Discussion"]`).
   - Transformed text snippets into numerical features using **TF-IDF Vectorization**:
     - Extracted the top 5000 unique terms from the text (ignoring stop words).
     - Represented each snippet as a vector based on term importance (TF-IDF score).

3. **Multi-Hot Encoding for Labels**:
   - Used `MultiLabelBinarizer` to convert label lists into **multi-hot vectors**:
     - Example: 
       - Labels: `["Positive", "Pricing Discussion"]`
       - Multi-hot Vector: `[1, 0, 0, 1, 0, 0]`  
         (if the full set of labels is: `["Positive", "Negative", "Objection", "Pricing Discussion", "Security", "Competition"]`).

4. **Split the Data**:
   - Divided the dataset into:
     - **80% training data**: Used to train the model.
     - **20% test data**: Used to evaluate the model's performance.

5. **Trained the Model**:
   - Chose **Logistic Regression** with `OneVsRestClassifier` for multi-label classification:
     - Each label is treated as a separate binary classification problem.
     - The model learns to predict whether each label applies to a given snippet.

6. **Evaluated the Model**:
   - Measured performance using:
     - **Precision**: How many of the predicted labels were correct.
     - **Recall**: How many of the actual labels were correctly predicted.
     - **F1-Score**: A balanced measure of Precision and Recall.
   - Printed a **classification report** showing these metrics for each label.

7. **Saved the Model and Preprocessing Steps**:
   - Saved the trained model, vectorizer, and label encoder for future use in building an inference pipeline.

---

#### **Why This Step is Beneficial for the Assessment**

1. **Core Objective**: 
   - The assignment explicitly requires a multi-label classification system. This step fulfills that requirement by building a model that can assign multiple categories to a snippet.

2. **Improved Accuracy**:
   - By splitting the dataset and evaluating the model, we ensure that the system generalizes well and is not just memorizing the training data.

3. **Reusable Pipeline**:
   - Saving the model, vectorizer, and label encoder ensures that this pipeline can be reused in the next steps (e.g., for building a REST API).

4. **Demonstrates Data Science Expertise**:
   - Handling multi-label problems is more challenging than single-label classification. Successfully implementing this step demonstrates advanced understanding of machine learning.

---

#### **Example**

1. **Input Snippet**:
   - "We love the analytics, but CompetitorX has a cheaper subscription."

2. **True Labels**:
   - `["Positive", "Pricing Discussion", "Competition"]`

3. **TF-IDF Representation**:
   - The text snippet is converted into a vector (e.g., `[0.1, 0.0, 0.5, 0.2, ...]`) based on the importance of terms.

4. **Model Prediction**:
   - The model outputs probabilities for each label:
     - Positive: 0.92 → **1 (Predicted)**
     - Negative: 0.12 → 0
     - Objection: 0.05 → 0
     - Pricing Discussion: 0.87 → **1 (Predicted)**
     - Security: 0.08 → 0
     - Competition: 0.79 → **1 (Predicted)**

5. **Final Output**:
   - Predicted Labels: `["Positive", "Pricing Discussion", "Competition"]`

---

#### **How It Helps in Real Scenarios**
- This trained model can automatically analyze sales/marketing call snippets and categorize them into relevant buckets. This is useful for companies to:
  - Understand common customer concerns (e.g., pricing, security).
  - Identify competitors mentioned in conversations.
  - Track positive and negative feedback trends.

---

#### **Next Steps**
With the trained model ready, we can move to **Step 6: Entity Extraction**, where we’ll extract specific details (like competitor names, compliance terms, pricing keywords) from the text snippets. Let me know when you’re ready to proceed!

## 6. Entity Extraction (Domain Knowledge Base + NER)

### Why This Step?
You need to detect domain-specific keywords (like competitor names or discount mentions) but also be able to handle more general entity recognition (for example, “SOC2,” “ISO compliance,” or anything not in your domain dictionary).

### How To Do It
1. **Dictionary Lookup**:
   - Load `domain_knowledge.json`.
   - For each text snippet, do a simple substring match to find any mention of the words in `competitors`, `features`, `pricing_keywords`.
   - Collect these matches into a set or list of “domain-based entities.”

2. **NER / Advanced Extraction**:
   - **Regex** or rule-based approach: Search for patterns. For example, if you often get references to certifications like “SOC2,” “ISO 27001,” you can have a small custom regex for these patterns.
   - **Pre-trained NER** (spaCy or Hugging Face):
     - spaCy approach: `doc = nlp(text_snippet)`, then check `ent.text` and `ent.label_`.
     - Combine them with your domain-based extraction. 
     - Example:
       ```python
       spacy_nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")
       doc = spacy_nlp(text_snippet)
       general_entities = [(ent.text, ent.label_) for ent in doc.ents]
       ```

3. **Merge Domain + NER Entities**:
   - Combine the dictionary-based entities with the general NER. 
   - Potentially store them as:
     ```json
     {
       "snippet_id": 1,
       "extracted_entities": {
         "domain": ["CompetitorX", "discount"],
         "general_ner": [("SOC2", "ORG")]
       }
     }
     ```

4. **Evaluation**:
   - For domain-specific keywords, you can easily measure if your matches are correct.
   - For general NER, you might do a quick manual check or rely on spaCy’s pre-trained performance.

#### Pro Tip (Advanced but Simple):
- If you want to “wow,” show how you handle synonyms. For example, if “CompetitorX” sometimes appears as “competitor X.” You can do a small fuzzy matching (`pip install fuzzywuzzy` or `rapidfuzz`) to catch small variations.

----
**Step 7: Summarization**!
---

## 7. Summarization

### Why This Step?
The assignment suggests generating a 1–2 sentence summary of the text snippet. This can be as simple or advanced as you want.

### How To Do It
1. **Basic Approach** (extractive summarization):
   - Take the top-N most important sentences via a simple scoring method (like TF-IDF).
   - If your “text_snippet” is very short (1-2 sentences anyway), you might just show part of the snippet.

2. **Advanced Approach** (transformer-based):
   - Use a Hugging Face summarization model (e.g., `distilbart-cnn-12-6` or `t5-small`).
   - That might be overkill if your snippets are small, but it’s “flashy” and might impress.

3. **Implementation**:
   - Quick solution with Hugging Face:
     ```python
     from transformers import pipeline
     summarizer = pipeline("summarization", model="t5-small") 
     summary = summarizer(text_snippet, max_length=30, min_length=5, do_sample=False)
     print(summary[0]['summary_text'])
     ```

---

## 8. Building a REST API (or CLI)

### Why This Step?
Your final deliverable is a microservice that takes a text snippet and returns:
1. Predicted Labels
2. Extracted Entities
3. Summary

### How To Do It
1. **Choose a framework**:
   - **Flask**: Simple, common for quick APIs.
   - **FastAPI**: More modern, automatically generates documentation at `/docs`.

2. **Create the Endpoint**:
   - A single `/predict` POST endpoint that accepts JSON like:
     ```json
     { "id": 1, "text_snippet": "We love the analytics, but CompetitorX has a cheaper subscription." }
     ```
   - Returns JSON like:
     ```json
     {
       "labels": ["Positive", "Pricing Discussion", "Competition"],
       "entities": {
         "domain": ["CompetitorX"],
         "general_ner": []
       },
       "summary": "We love the analytics but competitorx is cheaper."
     }
     ```

3. **Structure your code**:
   - **model.py**: loading your trained classification model (e.g., `pickle`, or a Hugging Face checkpoint).
   - **ner_extraction.py**: your domain knowledge + spaCy code.
   - **summarizer.py**: summarization pipeline or function.
   - **app.py**: the Flask or FastAPI app.

4. **Example Flask Snippet**:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
   import joblib
   import spacy

   app = Flask(__name__)

   # Load your model
   model = joblib.load('multi_label_model.pkl')
   vectorizer = joblib.load('vectorizer.pkl')
   spacy_nlp = spacy.load("en_core_web_sm")

   @app.route('/predict', methods=['POST'])
   def predict():
       data = request.json
       text = data.get('text_snippet')
       
       # 1) Classification
       text_vec = vectorizer.transform([text]) 
       predicted = model.predict(text_vec)
       # (You might convert predicted into label names here)
       
       # 2) Entity extraction
       doc = spacy_nlp(text)
       # plus dictionary lookup, etc.
       
       # 3) Summarization (if you integrated that)
       # ...
       
       return jsonify({
           "labels": ["PlaceholderLabel"],
           "entities": {"domain": ["Placeholder"], "general_ner": []},
           "summary": "A short summary"
       })

   if __name__ == '__main__':
       app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=5000)
   ```

#### Pro Tip (Advanced but Simple):
- Implement a **test CLI** script that does something like:
  ```bash
  curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/predict \
    -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
    -d '{"text_snippet": "We love the analytics..."}'
  ```
  This is nice for demonstration and for your README instructions.

---

## 9. Containerization (Docker)

### Why This Step?
It ensures your code can run anywhere without environment setup issues. A major requirement is a `Dockerfile` that describes how to build the image.

### How To Do It
1. **Install Docker** on your machine or use a service like [Docker Hub].
2. **Create a Dockerfile** (in the same folder as `app.py`):
   ```dockerfile
   FROM python:3.9-slim

   # 1. Create a working directory
   WORKDIR /app

   # 2. Copy requirements
   COPY requirements.txt .

   # 3. Install dependencies
   RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

   # 4. Copy your code
   COPY . .

   # 5. Expose the port (Flask usually on 5000)
   EXPOSE 5000

   # 6. Command to run on container start
   CMD ["python", "app.py"]
   ```
3. **Build and Run**:
   - `docker build -t my-nlp-service .`
   - `docker run -p 5000:5000 my-nlp-service`
   - Test with a POST request to `http://localhost:5000/predict`.

4. **(Optional) Deploy**:
   - For bonus points, deploy to **Heroku** (or any container-friendly platform like AWS, Google Cloud).
   - Make sure you add the `Procfile` for Heroku if needed:
     ```
     web: gunicorn app:app -b 0.0.0.0:$PORT
     ```

#### Pro Tip (Advanced but Simple):
- If you have a GPU-based approach, you might check **NVIDIA Docker** or specify a base image with CUDA. But that’s more advanced and not always needed for a small assignment.

---

## 10. Reporting & Final Submission

### Why This Step?
Your assignment specifically says you need:
1. **Short Technical Report** (~3 pages max)
2. **Public GitHub Repo** link
3. **Shared Google Colab** link (if you used it)

### How To Do It

1. **Technical Report Outline**:
   - **Data Handling**:
     - Summarize how you cleaned the data, any augmentation, and label processing.
   - **Modeling Choices**:
     - Why did you pick a particular approach (e.g., BERT vs. logistic regression, etc.)?
     - If you used advanced summarization or NER, mention it here.
   - **Performance Results**:
     - Provide your classification metrics (Precision, Recall, F1) for each label. 
     - If you did NER or dictionary-based extraction, show some quick metrics or at least examples.
     - Summarization can be shown with examples or any ROUGE scores if you’re advanced.
   - **Error Analysis**:
     - Show some snippets where your model predictions were wrong or partially correct, and discuss reasons.
   - **Future Work**:
     - Mention bigger dataset, more powerful language models, data augmentation strategies.

2. **GitHub Repo**:
   - Put your Dockerfile, your `app.py`, your model files (or instructions to download them if they’re large), dataset (`calls_dataset.csv`), domain knowledge file, and the short technical report (PDF or Markdown).

3. **Google Colab**:
   - If you did your entire experiment in Colab, just share the link with permission set to “Anyone with the link can view (and/or edit).”

#### Pro Tip (Advanced but Simple):
- You can embed images or graphs (confusion matrix) in your short technical report to illustrate your results. 
- A confusion matrix or a bar plot of label frequency is a nice visual to show you performed thorough analysis.

---

## Advanced Techniques (That Are Still Simple)

1. **Using a Pre-trained Transformer** (for classification and summarization)  
   - It’s impressive and simpler than training from scratch.
   - Example models: `bert-base-uncased`, `distilbert-base-uncased` for classification, `bart-base` or `t5-small` for summarization.

2. **Fuzzy Matching** in Dictionary Lookup  
   - Instead of plain substring matching, you could handle small misspellings. Quick to implement with libraries like `rapidfuzz`.

3. **Cross-Validation**  
   - Instead of a single train/test split, do **k-fold cross-validation**. This is easy in scikit-learn and shows deeper evaluation.

4. **Hyperparameter Tuning** with `Optuna` or `GridSearchCV`  
   - Instead of a manual guess, you can do a quick `GridSearchCV` on your logistic regression or random forest.

5. **Simple Explanation** of Model Predictions  
   - Tools like **LIME** or **SHAP** can help interpret which words are driving the classification. That’s definitely a “wow” factor if you have time.

---

## Putting It All Together

1. **Start in a Colab** (easiest for new people) or local environment.  
2. **Generate your data** (`calls_dataset.csv` and `domain_knowledge.json`).
3. **Clean and preprocess** your text (lowercase, etc.).
4. **Implement a multi-label classification** approach:
   - Vectorize text with TF-IDF or use a transformer model.
   - Evaluate with multi-label metrics.
5. **Implement entity extraction**:
   - Dictionary-based approach for domain-specific terms.
   - Possibly spaCy or Hugging Face for general NER.
6. **Implement summarization** (simple or advanced).
7. **Wrap everything** in a Flask or FastAPI endpoint.
8. **Write a Dockerfile**, build, and run your container.
9. **Produce your short technical report**:
   - Document data, model, results, error analysis, future improvements.
10. **Push** your code, Dockerfile, and dataset to **GitHub**.  
11. **Share** your Colab link and final GitHub repository link as required.

---

### Final Thoughts

- **Why** each step?
  - **Data** steps (cleaning, augmentation) ensure higher quality inputs and better model performance.
  - **Classification** is core to the assignment: you’re predicting multiple labels per snippet.
  - **Entity Extraction** is about combining domain knowledge with general NER, showing you can handle specialized terms beyond just standard NLP.
  - **Summarization** is an added feature that’s often desired in real use-cases (makes large texts more digestible).
  - **REST API + Docker** prove your solution is production-ready and not just code in a notebook.
  - **Technical report** demonstrates that you understand the reasoning behind your design, your results, and you can communicate them professionally.
